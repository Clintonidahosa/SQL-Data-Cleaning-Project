# SQL Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects and tasks that demonstrate my skills in database management, querying, and analysis. 
The projects involve working with real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights, optimize queries, and manage relational databases.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- Database design and schema creation
- Writing and optimizing SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)
- Data filtering, aggregation, and manipulation
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Performance optimization and indexing

## Project Highlights:
- **Sales Analysis**: Extracting and analyzing sales data to identify trends and key performance indicators.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Using SQL to categorize customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Inventory Management**: Designing a database and running queries to manage stock levels and supplier information.
